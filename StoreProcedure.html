    <span>It can be easily modified: We can easily modify the code inside the stored procedure without the need to
        restart or deploying the application. For example, If the T-SQL queries are written in the application and if we
        need to change the logic, we must change the code in the application and re-deploy it. SQL Server Stored
        procedures eliminate such challenges by storing the code in the database. so, when we want to change the logic
        inside the procedure we can just do it by simple ALTER PROCEDURE statement.

        Reduced network traffic: When we use stored procedures instead of writing T-SQL queries at the application
        level, only the procedure name is passed over the network instead of the whole T-SQL code.

        Reusable: Stored procedures can be executed by multiple users or multiple client applications without the need
        of writing the code again.

        Security: Stored procedures reduce the threat by eliminating direct access to the tables. we can also encrypt
        the stored procedures while creating them so that source code inside the stored procedure is not visible. Use
        third-party tools like ApexSQL Decrypt to decrypt the encrypted stored procedures.

        Performance: The SQL Server stored procedure when executed for the first time creates a plan and stores it in
        the buffer pool so that the plan can be reused when it executes next time.

        I am creating sample tables that will be used in the examples in this article.</span>
